I am currently a [AI Resident](https://ai.google/research/join-us/ai-residency) in the [Google Brain Team](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/). 
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Physics & Astronomy](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/) 
at [University of British Columbia (UBC)](http://www.ubc.ca/) in the String Theory Group. 
Before that, I did my PhD in [Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP)](http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) working on theoretical physics. 
My research interest is in theoretical physics and machine learning. Some details of my research is listed [here](/research/).
